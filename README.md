# C++ programming course materials
This repository contains materials for the "Scientific Programming (C++)" course I gave to MSc students in the University of Eastern Finland in autumn 2023.
Despite the fancy name, the course is an introductory course to C++. The materials include the lecture slides (pdf and PowerPoint format), and programming assignment instructions and their answers.
