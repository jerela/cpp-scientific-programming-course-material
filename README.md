# C++ programming course materials
This repository contains materials for the "Scientific Programming (C++)" [course](https://opas.peppi.uef.fi/en/course/LS00DB72/118309?period=2023-2024 "Link to the curriculum") I gave to MSc students in the University of Eastern Finland in autumn 2023.
Despite the fancy name, the course is an introductory course to C++. The materials include the lecture slides (pdf and PowerPoint format), and programming assignment instructions and their answers.
